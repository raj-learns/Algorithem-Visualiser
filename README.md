# Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualizer! This project provides interactive visualizations of various algorithms to help users understand their inner workings. You can explore how different algorithms process data step-by-step through engaging and easy-to-understand animations.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Step through algorithms with visual aids.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Includes visualizations for sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for a seamless experience.

## Algorithms Included

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort:** A simple comparison-based algorithm.
- **Selection Sort:** An in-place comparison sorting algorithm.
- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort:** A divide and conquer algorithm.
- **Quick Sort:** Efficient, comparison-based, and divide and conquer sorting algorithm.

### Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search:** Simple search algorithm that checks each element.
- **Binary Search:** Efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.

## How to Use

1. Visit the Algorithm Visualizer at [https://raj-learns.github.io/Algorithem-Visualiser/](https://raj-learns.github.io/Algorithem-Visualiser/).
2. Select an algorithm you want to visualize from the menu.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization.
4. Use the controls to step through the algorithm or play it continuously.
